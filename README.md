Data Science Portfolio Project 2025

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Use Cases
This project demonstrates potential applications in:
- Touchless gesture-based interfaces (e.g., smart homes, AR/VR)
- Sign language recognition systems
- Fitness and posture correction tracking
- Educational games and physical learning tools
- Real-time visual feedback systems

##  Knowledge Base
This project is built on:
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals** – image capture, color space conversion
- **Python Programming** – logic, libraries, real-time processing
- **OpenCV** – frame capture and manipulation
- **MediaPipe** – real-time ML models for landmark detection

##  How to Run
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells (allow webcam access)
4. Press `p` to stop the detection window
