- Educational games and physical learning tools
- Real-time visual feedback systems

## 📘 Knowledge Base
This project is built on:
- **Computer Vision Fundamentals** – image capture, color space conversion
- **Python Programming** – logic, libraries, real-time processing
- **OpenCV** – frame capture and manipulation
- **MediaPipe** – real-time ML models for landmark detection

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells (allow webcam access)
4. Press `p` to stop the detection window
